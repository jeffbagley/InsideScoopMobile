This folder should contain nine separate .ai files. The files names should be fairly self explanatory but this read me will touch on the purpose of each a tad bit. The Titles.ai file is used to create png images for various titles throught the application. It is simply a template in which you enter your desired text and export as a png. The Icon.ai file is the current app icon, which was used in the final app presentation. MainScreen.ai is the image used when the app first opens into the login/ signup screen. People.ai contains all of the characters used through the application. InsideScoopTruck.ai is the final truck design agreed upon and used throughout various screens. SignUpTruck.ai is the image used on the truck sign up page while SignUpUser.ai is the image used in the user sign up page. TruckOrUser.ai is the background on the page in which the user must say whether they are signing up as a food vendor or a customer. And Gradient.ai is the plain orange to blue gradient that is used uniformly throughout the application and on screens without their own designated .ai file.
